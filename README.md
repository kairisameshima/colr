How to play COLR:
Drag and launch the chameleon's tongue to eat the fruit. Tongue length is directly related to drag length (and drag angle). The fern's color is the desired color and each fruit corresponds to an RGB/CMYK value. Should one feel he/she has too much of a value, press the minus buttons to subtract values. In the bottom corner is a help button to help one see the current numerical values of RGB/CMYK. When one matches the target color (fern's color), the user will be prompted with a victory message, and an option to continue to the next level. 
User has the option to choose the interval by which the colors are generated (ie. multiples of 2 vs 32) as well as the whether to work in an RGB or CMYK Color model. Click the tabs on the lower right hand corner in order to view stats and change settings. Use the arrows to move the slider and simply tap on the color model which you wish to work in. You must click the start button to submit these settings changes and reset the level.
