How to play COLR:
Drag and launch the chameleon's tongue to eat the fruit. Tongue length is directly related to drag length (and drag angle). The fern's color is the desired color and each fruit corresponds to an RGB/CMYK value. Should one feel he/she has too much of a value, press the minus buttons to subtract values. In the bottom corner is a help button to help one see the current numerical values of RGB/CMYK. When one matches the target color (fern's color), the user will be prompted with a victory message, and an option to continue to the next level. Each level's target color is randomly generated before hand.
